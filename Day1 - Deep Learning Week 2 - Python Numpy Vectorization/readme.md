## Day 1: Matrix Multiplication and Vectorization Tutorial using Numpy 
 
**Today's Progress** : I have been working on Deep Learning specialization through Coursera along with working on Python Skills through Edx course. 


**Things covered**: 
  1. Overview to Numpy Package 
  2. Vectorization 
  3. Dot product using numpy 
  4. sigmoid function impelemention
  5. loss function for logistic Regression 
  6. Softmax function Implemention 

**Thoughts**: Keep me accountable and good start for working on DL and ML basics. Goal is to solve complex problem.
